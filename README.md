# Youtube-Video-Downloader
Simple way to download videos in either mp3 or mp4 formats.

## Description
this project was made using python and uses the pytube module.
The video you download will be saved directly into the folder in which the python file exists.

## Dependencies
For this python file to run, you will need to install the pytube module.
You can do this by simply opening your terminal and typing pip install pytube.
In the future I will try to make it an executable file.
